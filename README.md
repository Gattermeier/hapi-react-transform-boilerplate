# Boilerplate / Starterkit for React Hot Loading with Hapi & Webpack

# Usage    
```
git clone https://github.com/Gattermeier/hapi-react-transform-boilerplate.git   
npm install   
npm start   
open http://localhost:3000   
```

To see hot reloading in action, modify App.jsx file. Upon save, webpack will re-compiled and re-loaded in the browser. To see error catching inside render() .. um .. produce some errors in render() in App.jsx  ;)   


# Note:    
* This project does not use React Hot Loader. Read  **[Dan Abramov's article on Medium on that](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-death-of-react-hot-loader-765fa791d7c4)**
* Don't use this in production, only for development purposes or template for your own implementation
